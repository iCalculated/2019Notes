### TODO

- Homework lmao.

### Facts

- I should have assigned the problem to you next week.
- This is the last of the one last things
- I just pretend everything is the same 
- *(on naming)* I added some letters in the middle, it'll get worse later
- because convention *swingy arm movement*
- Oh. I'm actually out of material.

### Homework Notes

- 3 was grindy
- 5 was not meant to be that hard

### Monomial Ideals

- **Def'n:** Generated from monomials. 
- **Lemma:** If $$I=\langle x^{\alpha} \vert  \alpha \in A\rangle$$ and $$x^{\beta}\in I$$ then there exists an $$\alpha$$ such that $$x^{\alpha} \vert  x^{\beta}$$. 
- **Staircase Diagram:** Can draw divisor boxes to explain which monomials are in the ideal
- **Dickson's Lemma:** Every monomial ideal has a finite generating set. 
- **$$LI(I)$$:** $$\{LT(f)\vert f\in I\}$$
- **Initial ideal:** $$in(I) = \langle LT(I) \rangle$$

### Groebner Basis

- **Def'n:** A set of polynomials $$g_1,\dots,g_s$$ is a Groebner basis for $$I$$ if 
    1. $$I\langle g_1,\dots,g_s\rangle
    1. $$in(I)=\langle LT(g_1),\dots,LT(g_s)\rangle
- Depends on ordering
- Remainder does not depend on order when dividing
