### TODO

- Weekly

### Announcements

- Exam next week
    - 7 curve handshake &rarr; 21 things to be able to derive

### Perfect Competition

- Traits:
    - Products are standardized
        - fake because no one wants to be standardized
    - Lots of firms
        - fake because firms want to be unique
    - Firms are price-takers
        - fake because real world price-setting is weird
    - Free entry and exit
        - fake because of manufacturing
- Firms avoid perfect competition, because perfect competition &rarr; literally zero profit.

### Costs

- Literally breaking down the terms, nothing to it.

### Short-term Analysis

- Steps:
    1. Find $$Q*$$ where $$MC=MR$$. 
        - Marginal revenue will be the price because this class is not able to comprehend calculus.
    2. Find ATC and AVC for $$Q*$$. 
    3. Calculate profits, comparison to FC, etc...
        - Decision tree:
        - Is $$MR > AVC?$$
            - Yes &rarr; IS $$MR > ATC?$$
                - Yes &rarr; *grofit*
                - No &rarr; produce to offset part (or all) of FC 
            - No &rarr; shut down. Take FC in loss.
