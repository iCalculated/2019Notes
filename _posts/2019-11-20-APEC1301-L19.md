### TODO

### Announcement

### Game Theory

- Game must have players, strategy, and payoff
- To simplify assume full information, two players, and one-shot

### Nash Equilibrium

- **Def'n:** Neither player wants to change strategy unilaterally
- A strategy is dominant if you do not need to consider what opponents do
    - Thus, you can exploit your parents

### Prisoner's Dilemma

- (skipping most context)
- For a game to be a PD, both players must have dominant strategies and both playing the dominant strategies must put them worse off.
