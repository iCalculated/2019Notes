### TODO

- Homework lmao.

### Facts

- I didn't expect people to do as badly on that as they did
- When you know something everything is obvious
- There are two ways to make a problem too hard, one of which is that it's just too hard 
- Every time I write parantheses and G's my parentheses turn into G's
- It's not great
- Some of them are correct but... *[pauses before continuing]*
- Some are long-winded and useless
- Technically everything you said is true, but not meaningful
- Hey look, same word!
- This is one of the problems with math.
- I'm being slightly less detailed than I would be on paper.
- *[on the topic of \not]* Sometimes it puts the line in a stupid place
- *[turns out \not\mid ($$\not\mid$$) looks terrible but \nmid ($$\nmid$$) is a command]*
- *[trying to stop talking about \not when he himself started it]* We're on a terrible tangent though
- *[still on that tangent}* I'm not saying all mac users are idiots...
- As long as your not circular it's fine
- Problem 1 on 7 was not *meant* to be difficult
- Remember, for this class there is nothing I *have* to get to
- We can always go slower

### Homework Review

- Jay "couldn't fine time to grade" x2
- 7-1: 
    - Same sets and monomial &rarr; unique "minimal" generating set.
    - $$LT(G)$$ and $$LT(\tilde{G})$$ are minimal generating sets, suppose redundancy then check divisibility.
- 9-3:
    - More struggle than expected
    - 

(if the extension thm is so good why is there not a sequel?)

### Extension Thm 2

- **Extension Thm:** Let $$I=\langle f_1,\dots f_s\rangle \subseteq \mathbb{C}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$$ let $$I_1$$ be the first elimination ideal for all $$1\leq i \leq S$$ write 
$$f_i = g_c(x_2,\dots,x_n)x_1^{N_i} + \dots$$ 
followed by the terms with lower degree on $$x_1$$, with $$g_c \neq 0$$ and $$N_i \geq 0$$. Suppose $$(a_2,\dots,a_n)$$ is a partial solution if $$(a_2,\dots,a_n)\notin V(g_1,\dots,g_s)$$ $$\exists a_1$$ such that $$(a_1,\dots,a_n)\in V(I)$$. 
    - Working understanding: Terms can be grouped and then extended to *somehow* derive solutions through extension
    - (I did not just copy from last week)
