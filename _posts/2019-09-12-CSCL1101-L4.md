### Announcements

- Paper 1 Prompt Thursday
- Three classes for the tempest, then modern interpretations

### TODO

- Read *The Tempest*, Acts 1 and 2

### The Myth of Whitness

- *TL;DR:* Greek statues were actually colored
- **Aesthetics:** The study of baeuty and artistic taste 
- Not having a historical precedent forces us to reconsider why we hold our ideals
    - Specifically color &rarr; crude and ugly and white &rarr; pristine and refined
    - Willful denial becomes a factor when there are commited groups

### Antigone

- Chorus play a variety of roles, mainly mediating and amplifying.
    - Illustrates the lack of a villain
- Antigone is a woke biopolitical play about the creation of the outsider
- Lots ofjuxtaposition:
    - Customs vs laws
    - Insider vs outsider
    - Masculine vs feminine
    - King vs subjects
    - Young vs old
    - Obedience vs diobedience 

### Thoughts

- I want to say something innacurate and watch Prof Lewis say "Yeah, good."
