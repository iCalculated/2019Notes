### TODO

- Study for first exam

### Center of Mass

Apply calculus. *Congratulations!*

### Energy
 
Conservation of energy says movement must come from some form of potential energy and vice versa. Potential energy is storage that can be converted back and fourth, an example being gravitational which is released as things move down.

Expressed as $$U=U_o + \Delta U$$, usually care about relative rather than absolute.
