### Bartleby 2

    - Bartleby puts all effort into work, burns out
    - Entirely alienated, all life goes into production
- Look, identity politics!
    - No women
    - (It's a stretch)
- Look, self-insertion!
    - Melville first wrote generic but grofitable adventure novels
    - Now rejects and writes philosophy
- Look, hyperreality!
    - Language does not create connections
    - (Language is violence!)
