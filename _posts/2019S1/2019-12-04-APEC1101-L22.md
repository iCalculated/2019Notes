### Lorenz Curve

Visual representation of income equality, percent of income by percent of households in order of income. Line is perfectly linear and equivalent if equal, drops beneath if not perfect.

The Gini ratio is the area above the Lorenz curve beneath the perfect equality curve divided by the area under the perfect equality curve.

### Misconceptions

Poverty $$\neq$$ inequality, some countries may have high but unequal wages while others may have lower wages for everyone.
Wealth $$\neq$$ income, income is the derivative of wealth.

### Growing Inequality 

Market system is very good at creating inequality.

Skilled workers are needed more, unioninism is dying, the bourgeoisie are consolidating and immigrants are unpopular.

Wealth has power over politics, so no reason for them to change the system.
