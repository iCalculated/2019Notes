### TODO

- Homework hypothetically
- Lab 6, Problem 1

### Announcement

- TAs have not finished grading the exam 

### Recap

- Torque is $\vec{\tau}=\vec{r}\times\vec{F}=\vec{\alpha}=\vec{\tau}/I$
- Magnitude of $\tau = rF\sin{\theta},$ such that $\theta$ is the included angle.
- Linear forces $\propto$ angular forces, wrt to $R$
- Gravity creates torque, treat as pulling on center of gravity

### Massive Pulleys

- (helped someone with this topic before class)
- Static friction betweenrope and pulley tranfers energy without slipping
- Torque of $\tau = F_fR=R(T_1-T_2)$

### Rolling Objects

- Nevermind
