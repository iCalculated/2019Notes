### TODO

- Homework lmao.

### Facts

- I've not finished the homework... No, not because it was bad.
- Ignore this problem because I can't adequately explain to you
- *Try to* parametrize... *try to* 
- I still haven't proven that any of this stuff works
- It's not that hard to prove that this GB stuff is correct
- *[18th of a second later]* This is going to be a vague proof
- Pi does not equal pi always
- There are things called restrictions, but they are not relevant here
- *[I try to repeatedly Detexify $$\mapsto$$ and keep getting longmapsto]*
- Apparently I'm confused by pictures
- I'm terrible with pictures
- I get to write down one of the messiest theorems in this book
- There are a lot of words because there are a lot of words
- I'm not sure if this is the same level of precision, but it's equally true
- *[Side conversation about solving systems: "Oh you cut something, then it's gone?"]*
- I wrote one of these wrong, but I don't know which one. It doesn't matter.

### Homework Review

- Jay "couldn't fine time to grade"
- 8-3 subtlety: must be an irreducible hypersurface

### Elimination Ideal

- **Def'n:** Let $$I\subseteq k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$$ be an ideal, then 
$$I_k := I \cap k[x_{k+1},\dots,k_n]$$ 
for $$0\leq k \leq n$$ is the $$k$$th elimination ideal.
- **Elimination Thm:** If $$G$$ is a lex gb with $$x_1>\dots>x_n$$ then $$G_k:=G\cap k[x_{k+1},\dots,x_n]$$ is a lex gb for $$I_k$$.
- **Projection map:** $$\pi_k: \mathbb{A}^n\to\mathbb{A}^{n-k}$$, maps a point $$(a_1,\dots,a_n)\mapsto (a_{k_1},\dots,a_n)$$.
 
### Closure 

- **Closure Thm:** Let $$I\subseteq k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$$ and $$V=V(I)$$ then $$V(I_k)$$ is the smallest variety containing $$\pi_k(V)$$ and if $$V\neq 0$$ there exists $$W\subseteq V(I_k)$$ such that $$V(I_k) - W\subseteq \pi_k(V)$$.
- Note: The smallest variety in $$\mathbb{A}^1$$ containing $$\mathbb{Z}$$ is $$\mathbb{A^1}$$.

### Messy Thm 

- **Partial Solution:** $$(a_2,\dots,a_n)\in V(I_1)$$
    - Pretty much means there exists a (hyper)point within the hypersurface defined by $$\pi_k$$
- **Extension Thm:** Let $$I=\langle f_1,\dots f_s\rangle \subseteq \mathbb{C}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$$ let $$I_1$$ be the first elimination ideal for all $$1\leq i \leq S$$ write 
$$f_i = g_c(x_2,\dots,x_n)x_1^{N_i} + \dots$$ 
followed by the terms with lower degree on $$x_1$$, with $$g_c \neq 0$$ and $$N_i \geq 0$$. Suppose $$(a_2,\dots,a_n)$$ is a partial solution if $$(a_2,\dots,a_n)\notin V(g_1,\dots,g_s)$$ $$\exists a_1$$ such that $$(a_1,\dots,a_n)\in V(I)$$. 
    - Working understanding: Terms can be grouped and then extended to *somehow* derive solutions through extension
- Proof left to those who actually read the textbook ~~beyond the sections about robotics.~~
- Example: $$f_1=xy-1\implies f_1 = (y)x^1+\dots$$ and $$f_2=xz-1\implies f_2=(z)x+\dots$$ in least dramatic terms. This tells us that if $$(a_2,a_3)\in V(y,z) =\{0,0\}$$ then there exists an $$a_1$$ such that $$(a_1,a_2,a_3)\in V$$.
