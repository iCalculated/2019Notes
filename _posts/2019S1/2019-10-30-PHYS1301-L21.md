### TODO

- Lab Problem 3-5
- Apparently there is a quiz next friday
    - Thus practice available 
    - Cumulative, focus on 9 and 10

### Announcement (singular)

- Haines is lecturing today
    - He actually looked at the slides beforehand
    - Can actually perform demos ("years of study")

### Centripetal Acceleration

$a_c = \dfrac{v^2}{R}=\omega^2 R$
- Accounts for $\omega R = v$ because original definition is *technically* correct but misleading.
- Usually for rigid rotation
- $F_c = ma_c = m\dfrac{v^2}{R}=m\omega^2  R$
- To stay along arc requires frictional force which is equal to centripetal force
    - Friction is static since no radial velocity
- Maximum velocity along arc with radius $r$ and static friction coefficient $\mu_s$ is 
$V=\sqrt{\mu_s g R}$

### Rotational Motion

- Things don't slide. They rotate.
- Many analogous equations ($a\to\alpha$, $v\to\omega$, $x\to\theta$):
    - Radians do not have dimensions (making them easy to lose)
$ \alpha = \dfrac{d\omega}{dt}=\dfrac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}$

- Constant angular acceleration:
    - $\omega = \omega_0 + \alpha t$
    - $\theta = \theta_0 + \omega_0 t + \dfrac{1}{2}\alpha t^2$
    - (I'm just typesetting for fun at this point)
- Arclength $s=R\theta$, which is why we *appreciate* radians
    - From that, $v=R\omega$ follows and so on.
    - Tangential acceleration also exists, $a_t = R\alpha$

### Moment of Inertia

- **Moment of Inertia:** $I=mr^2$ with a summation if describing a system
- Rotational enery of an object
$K=\dfrac{1}{2}I\omega^2$

- Thus, takes more enery needed with greater moment
