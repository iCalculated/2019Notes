### TODO

- Lab Problem 3-5
- Actually study

### Announcements 

- Extra office hours Tues + Wed PAN110 1000-1100
- Exam exists

### Recap

- Rotational kinetic energy is $$K=\dfrac{1}{2}I\omega^2$$
- $$I$$ is moment of intertia: $$I=\sum_i m_ir_i^2$$
    - Notably depends on axis of rotation
- Total kinetic energy is rotational plus linear energy

### Moment of inertia

- Varies with axis of rotation
- For continuous objects $$I=\int_0^M r^2\ dm$$
- In integrals mass per unit length is a good trick
    - $$\lambda = M/L$$
    - Thus, rod rotating around an end has moment of inertia $$\dfrac{M}{3}L^2$$.
- Regular shapes, all in form $$I=c(MR2)$$: 
    - Hollow cylinder along axis: $$c=1$$
    - Solid rod along perpendicular: $$c=\frac{1}{2}$$
    - Thin sphere along diameter: $$c=\frac{2}{3}$$
    - Solid sphere: $$c=\frac{2}{5}$$
    - (2 more)

### Sliding along incline

- All objects have the same speed if not rolling
- Velocity at bottom is $$\sqrt{2gh}$$, no dependance on mass without friction
- Rolls without slipping:
    - $$v_{cm}=\omega R\implies K_{tot} = \dfrac{1}{2}mv^2_{cm} + \dfrac{1}{2}\dfrac{I}{R^2}v^2_{cm}$$
    - Increasing $$R$$ lowers fraction.
    - For fixed $$R$$ greater $$I$$ results in more rotational energy
