### TODO

- Homework lmao.

### Facts

- I'm sure a lot of you wrote things you weren't proud of and I don't want to read it either
- *(after writing proof)* What is the question we were actually asking? *(checks notes)*
- **literally** no statement I say today will not be dependent on monomial order
- aaaabddddeeeeeeeiiilllmmmnnnnnnnoooooooprrssttttttwyy
- Everything is dependent on monomial order
- This is philosophy so you don't need to take notes on this

### Groebner Bases

- **Thm:** Base generates its ideal (surprise?)
- **Hilbert's Basis Thm:** Every ideal in a polynomial ring has a finite generating set.
- **Cor:** Groebner bases have unique remainders when dividing, if remainder is zero the divided term must be in the ideal.
- **Remainder notation:** For $G=(g_1,\dots,g_s)$, $\bar{f}^G$ is the remainder when $f$ is divided by $G$. 
- **S-Polynomial:** The S-polynomial of $f,g$ is 
$
S(f,g)=\dfrac{x^{\omega}}{LT(f)}\dot f - \dfrac{x^{\omega}}{LT(g)}\dot g 
$
where $x^{\omega}=LCM(LM(f),LM(g))
    - Ruins the leading terms

### Buchberger's Algorithm

- Finds groebner bases with *abysmal* runtime 

### Ascending Chain Condition

- If $I_1\subset I_2 \subset \dots$ is an ascending chain of ideals then there exists an $N$ such that for all $i>N$, $I_i=I_N$.
- Hilbert Bases in disguise
