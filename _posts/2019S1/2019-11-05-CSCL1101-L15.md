- *Never Let Me Go* next.

## Final Exam

- Will have week to work on
- 4 prompts, handed out final day of class
    - Choose 2, 2 pages each

## Setting

- Time and place
    - Can do both macro and micro-analysis of both

### Signifiances

- Can focus on a specific aspect and then generalize
- Setting is used to establish credibility
- Provides circumstances of the characters
- Literary symbol: can highlight specific elements
- Establish atmosphere and mood

### Analysis Points

- How does the narrative change locations and time?
- How detailed are descriptions? Also, specfic vs abstract?
- How are locations and characters connected?

## Persepolis 

### Graphic Novels

- Combines literary and visual elements
- Term traditionally used for fiction
- More control over pace (???)

### *Mis-en-page*

- **Panel:** Each box within the page
- **Frame:** Edge of panel
- **Gutter:** Space between panels
    - Control movement of time
- **Caption:** Label of panel's contents
- **Speech Balloon:** This is getting ridiculous
- **Splash Panel:** Panel that consumes more of the page
    - Used to assign value
- **Splash Page:** Splash Panel but full page.

### Context

- From 2003, Bush was like "look at Ir\* &rarr; axis of evil"
    - *Persepolis* adds other side
- Book moves between personal and familial
- Both about overall effecs of revolution and individual experience

### "Analysis"

- Monochromatic
    - Inversion is used to create tension
- Very stylized
    - Juxtaposition of literal photographs of dead bodies as compared to childish interpretation
    - She said violence is too normalized to include, realism reduces
    - Not about elimination, instead stripping away details provides focus
