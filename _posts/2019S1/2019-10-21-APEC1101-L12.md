### Announcements

### TODO

- ACE
- Report Final

### Costs

- **Explicit costs:** Cost of other group's resources
- **Implicit costs:** Cost of own resources

and another class, being 

- **Fixed cost:** Not changed with quantity
- **Variable cost:** Changes with quantity.

- **Economic Profit:** Total revenue with costs subtracted
- **Acounting Proit:** Total revenue minus just explicit
    - not including salaries and such
    - also known as normal profit

### Time

- **Long run:** Situation in which there is no fixed input constraint
    - One decision is made it's short run again, constraint in place
- **Short run:** Not long term, fixed inputs exist
- Different degrees  of fixedness, like an employee that you can pay to terminate is inbetween

- **Law of Dimishing Returns:** Additional output from variable will diminish as increase to infinity
    - Short run since relying on fixed inputs


### Production

- Calculate costs per unit of output
- Fixed cost per unit asymptotically approaches zero 
- Average variable cost looks like a U because high quantity decays value
    - Law of dimishing returns
