### TODO

- "Read" *Persepolis*
    - Probably should re-read it.
- 11.5: Paragraph proposal
- 11.12: One body paragraph
- 11.21: Essay 

## Paper

### What is a body paragraph?

- Should have an initial claim, analysis, and purpose
- If you want an A arrange your paragraphs (and don't assume the debate definition of structure :/)
- Refer back to thesis.
- (Actually important) Inductive > deductive.
- Considering that the paper is 5 pages be overanalytical.

## Components

### Diction

- Resource about diction on canvas.
- How are parts of speech used?

### Atttude/Tone

- How does character describe?
- Feelings on subject matter?

### THemes

- What is text trying to get across?
- How does it take a stance?
    - Notably not an argument, a theme can't be "wrong"

## Through the Arc of the Rainforest

### Globalization

- Detaches local cultures
    - Feather usage spreads out of the Matacao
- Displacement for advantage occurs
    - Mane Pena watches himself lecture in other languages

### Simulacrum

- (hmm, I wonder where this could be from)
- (he is one sentence from saying Baudrillard)
- **Def'n:** Imitation without any original.
- Update: Did not say Baudrillard

### Ecological Satire

- (told us to write on paper for turn in)
