### Recap

$$U_{\text{SHM}}=\dfrac{1}{2}m\omega^2x^2$$ and $$a=-\omega^2 x$$

Pendulum: 

- $$\omega=\sqrt{\dfrac{g}{L}}$$
- $$a=-\dfrac{g}{L}x$$

Spring: 

- $$\omega=\sqrt{\dfrac{k}{m}}}$$
- $$a=-\dfrac{k}{m}x$$

### Vertical Springs

$$F=-ky$$ is still true. Thus, equilibrium is when $$-ky-mg=0\implies y_0=\dfrac{-mg}{k}$$. This in turn suggests that it's still simple harmonic motion.
