### Announcements

- Liu guessed my name with no hints

### Opportunity Costs

- **Def'n:** What must be given up to get something
- **Ceteris Paribus:** Other things being equal, focusing on *x* variables
- **Marginal Benefit:** Benefit from engaging in an activity
    - Typically decreases with activity, ex: one sandwich good, second sandwich less good
- **Total Benefit:** Integral of MB
- **Total Cost:** Integral of MC
- **Net Gain:** Integral between MB and MC up to a point, surplus if positive

### Cost Benefit Analysis

- **Def'n:** Maximizing surplus, if MC > MB &rarr; decrease, MC=MB &rarr; stay, MC < MB &rarr; increase.
- Study four hours for the exam.
- **Binding Constraint:** A limit on optimization, that prevents reaching a maximum, non-binding if the constraint is not a limiting factor. 

### Individual (Budget Line) and Society

- **Budget line:** Linear algebra combinations within budget
    - Slope is exchange rate
- Society has four types of resources
    - Land &rarr; natural resources
    - Labor &rarr; workers
    - Capital &rarr; human-made resources
    - Entrepreneurial Ability &rarr; ability to produce 

### Questions

- **Q:** Is opportunity relative to optimization?
    - Opportunity is relative to best alternative
    - Scheduling is not a factor beyond expected value
- **Q:** Why is hour cost increasing?
