### TODO

- Weekly

### Announcements

- Exam next week
- Liu totally gives away midterm topics

### Context

- Monopolies don't exist in most places 
    - Oh wait, ISPs
- Sherman Antitrust Act from 1890 is doing a pretty good job
- Monopolies exist for a few reasons: 
    - Lobbying.
    - (Also intellectual property to encourage research)
    - (Natural monopoly, does not make sense to have multiple)

### Basics

- Still have $$P=AR$$ but not $$MR=D$ as in perfect competition
- Monopolist takes intersection, $$MC=MR$$, price is then relative to demand curve
    - Highest quantity such that $$MR>MC$$
- Secondary markets *exist*

### Efficiencies

- Productive means P=ATC, firms producing at the least possible cost
- Allocative means D=MR=P=AR, specifically D=MC, the rest are given assumptions. No surplus or shortage
