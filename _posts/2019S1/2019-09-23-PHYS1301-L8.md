### TODO

- Study for first exam

### Recap

- In classical mechanics frames share time 
    - Does not hold for special relativitity
- Earth is not an intertial reference frame
    - Rotation of earth is significant
- Hurricanes can not cross the equator

### Convertible Energy

- **Def'n:** Kinetic energy that is converted
    - Which of the energy can be converted?
- Energy that can not be converted is that of system, relative to center of mass movement
    - Remaining can be converted
