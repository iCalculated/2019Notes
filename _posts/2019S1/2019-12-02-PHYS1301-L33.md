### Oscillation

- Everything oscillates

$x(t)=A\sin(\omega t +\phi_I)$

such that $\omega=\dfrac{2\pi}{T}$ is angular frequency and $\phi_{i}$ is initial phase. The length of the period is $T$.

Spring productes harmonic motion with $\omega = \sqrt{k/m}$

To do problems use derivatives.

Initial phase derivative is cool, $\phi_{i}=\atan{\omega}x_0}{v_o}$

and we have $A=\dfrac{x_0}{\sin{\phi_0}}$
