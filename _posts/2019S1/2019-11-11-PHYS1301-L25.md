### TODO

- Homework hypothetically

### Announcements 

- These notes were taken the day after the lecture, so they may be unusually succint

### Angular Momentum, Vector-Edition

We have $$\vec{L} = \vec{r}\times\vec{p}=m\vec{r}\times\vec{p}= I\vec{\omega}$$ with magnitude $$\vert \vec{L}\vert =  mr\omega = mvr\sin{\theta}$$.

### Torque

Exists, is analogous to force. We have $$\tau = \dfrac{d\vec{L}{dt} = m \alpha.$$
