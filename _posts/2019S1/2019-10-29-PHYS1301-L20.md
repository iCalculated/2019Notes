### TODO

- Homework?

### Forces 

- Radial direction, from the center
- Tangential direction, tangent to curve

### Uniform Circular

- Period of $$2\pi R$$, such that $$R$$ is the radius. Thus 
$$v = \dfrac{2\pi R}{T}$$
- Angular velocity just ignores the radius term, 
$$\omega = \dfrac{2\pi}{T}$$
- More fun in polar coordinates
- We have $$\vec{a}=-\omega^2 \vec{r}$$
    - Thus acceleration is along the radial axis, inwards
    - Centripetal force: $$F_c = ma_c= m\dfrac{v^2}{R}$$ 

### Non-Uniform Circular

- Velocity vector has changing magnitude
- Tangential velocity is 
$$a_T = \dfrac{dv}{dt}$$
    - (no I didn't need to write that, just wanted to see how it formats)
- Total acceleration is $$\vec{a}=\vec{a}_T + \vec{a}_c$$, tangential plus centripetal

### Pendulum

- (chapter 15)
- Centripetal acceleration since along circle, of $$\dfrac{v^2}{R}$$ 
- Tangential acceleration also should exist.
