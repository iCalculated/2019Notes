### TODO

- Homework Chapter 10, 11, 12 *and* 13
- Homework 15, for final
- Lab

### Announcement

- Still quiz Friday
- I need a 70 on the final to get an A

### Potential Energy

Dependent on height, simply $$U=mgh$$. Motion is largely symmetrical with respect to energy.

### Model

Gravitational torque is $$\tau = -mgL\sin{\theta}$$, related to motion by second law: $$\alpha = \dfrac{-mgL\sin{\theta}}{mL^2}$$. Thus, 

$$\dfrac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} = \dfrac{g\sin{\theta}}{L} \implies \text{nevermind, it's a transcendental function}.$$

Instead, we use a Taylor approximation, only the first term because physicists are lazy. It's good enough for small angles. Any we now have to

$$\dfrac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} = -\dfrac{g}{L} \theta\implies \omega^2 = \dfrac{g}{L}.$$

Thus, the period is the same regardless of starting height, mass has no effect on the angular frequency, and length is inversely proportional to frequency. In some situations the system is accelerating differently, which is directly proportional.

### Weird Shapes

Can *not* pretend they are point masses.

Instead, $$\omega^2 = \dfrac{mgL}{I}$$.
