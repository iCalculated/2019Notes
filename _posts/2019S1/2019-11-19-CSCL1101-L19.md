### TODO

- 11.21: Essay 

## Never Let Me Go

### Developments

- Oh look, they are clones.
- Cloned from low-quality human beings
- Still no real explanation of the system, just Kathy rambling

Can be read in terms of race, sexuality, etc. Any issue that is centered around the idea of the other because the group is excluded.

### Resistance

- Security: Pretty much the umbrella point, they are provided with everything they need, including validation, and the outside world is a big unknown
- Isolation: Halisham and such are so removed from the "real" world that they would not know how to exist in it.
- Internalization: Social values result in not questioning ~~and McCarthyism~~
- Inferiority: View themselves as less than human because of source material

Ishiguro himself said that he's always impressed by how everyne is habituated in some way, normalized injustice is a fact of everyday life.

### Deferral

- Only available to a sub-group (Hailsham)
- Note how it differs in further reading
- With same end result is deferral more ethical?
