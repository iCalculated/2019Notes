### TODO

- ACE
- Study for exam?

### Review

- Allocative efficiency because benefit to society (price) is equal to cost of production (MC)
- Zero profit, since $P=ATC$
- Productive efficiency because production occurs at the minimum possible cost

### Monopoly

- Entry is blocked
    - Thus profit exists
- Marginal revenue is lower than price
    - Selling additional units requires a lower price
    - Because monopoly owns industry vs price-taking
- Single seller with no close substitute
    - Usually because entry was blocked, patents and such
- Can be a "fringe" when not the *entire* market is controlled but enough to practically influence it
- **Natural Monopoly:** When economy of scale creates a monopoly through high initial cost.

### Profit Maximization

- Monopoly chooses unit elastic point on demand curve.
    - (this took about 20 minutes to explain, but was thankfully self-evident)
- When MC is actually nonzero find intersection of MB and MC

### Dead-Weight Loss

- Socially we all suffer because products are priced higher at lower quantity
    - Not productively *or* allocatively efficientl
