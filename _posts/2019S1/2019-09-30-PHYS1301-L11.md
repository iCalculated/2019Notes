### TODO

- Study for first exam (too late) (even later now)
- Quiz 2
- Homework?
- Read book?

### Potential Energy 

- Energy of mass is $mgh$
- In a system the center of mass can be used
- Convertible energy is stil relative to the CoM, moving at the average speed
    - Subtract CoM momentum from kinetic total

### Forces

- Our boy Newton
    - All three of his laws are relative to conservation of momentum
- Laws:
    - Object at rest stays at rest until acted upon
    - Acceleration is proportional to net force and inversely proportional to mass, $F=ma$. True definition is $F$ is change in momentum over time.
    - Every force a body exerts results in an opposite force upon it
