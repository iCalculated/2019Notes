### TODO

- Homework
- Quiz next week :(
    - In Tate B50
- Lab 2 Problem 7

### Force

- Force is change in momentum over change in time

### Work 

- Work is force on an object, $W=\vec{F} \dot \Delta\vec{r}$, notably it's a signed scalar. 
- Unit is $kg m^2/s^2$
- Difference in kinetic energies
    - Work is changing enery
- $\Delta K=W_{net}$
