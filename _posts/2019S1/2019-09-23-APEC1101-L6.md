### Announcements

### TODO

- ACE 2B

### Supply and Demand

- Along demand curve more is demanded at lower price
- Supply is up sloping: 
    - Low hanging fruit principle
    - Increasing OC principle
    - Law of diminishing returns
- Demand is down sloping:
    - Diminishing utility
    - Purchasing power effect
    - Substitutioin between goods
- Change in demand means line is translated
- Change in quantity demanded is point moving

### Aggregation

- Price against quality
- Horizontally stack

### Equilibrium

- If excess supply producer makes less
    - Converse applies
- Surplus is sold at lower price which createsm more demand

### Shifting

- All intuitive
- Inferior good deman goes down with income
    - Inferior does not mean quality, such as rice in Japan replaced by produce
