### Mass

- **Def'n:** How much matter is in an object.
    - Increases resistance to acceleration (intertia)
    - Mass $$\neq$$ weight,  weight is gravity axerting force on mass

### Momentum

- **Linear momentum:** $$p=mv$$, st $$m$$ is mass and $$v$$ is velocity, generally in kg m/s. 
    - Momentum is signed with velocity.
    - A system of objects has total momentum, which is the sum of individual values
        - Total momentum is preserved in isolation, even if mass or quantity changes
        - Rockets function because of conservation of momentum
