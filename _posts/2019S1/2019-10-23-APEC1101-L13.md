### TODO

- ACE
- Report Final

### Computing MC 

- **Momentum:** Difficulty of changing trend
- Literally add fixed and variable costs

### Return to Scale

- Cconstant return via replication
- Increasing returns to scale, consolidating
- Decreasing returns to scale, oversized (diseconomy)
- Long run ATC takes mins from short term

### Minimum Efficient Scale

- **Def'n:** Lowest level of output at which long-run average cost is minimized
- Based on curve industry type can be extracted

### Market Structures

- Main types are monopoly, monopolostic competition, oligopoly, and peerfect competition
