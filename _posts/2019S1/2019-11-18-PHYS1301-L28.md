### TODO

- Lab 6, Problem 1

### Announcement

- Exam distribution was fine

### Recap

- Torque on pulley is $\tau = TR,$ witih angular velocity $\alpha = \tau / I$.
- Massive pulley has torque equal to difference of tensions: $\tau = T_1R-T_2R.$
- Rotational kinematics is correlated to linear kinematics wrt to radius.

### Rolling Objects

- Pretty much put together given tools and remember friction.

### Static Equilibrium

- **Def'n:** When a rigid body stays at rest. Both torque and force must be zero.
- Lever can be an example
- Center of mass must have support
