### TODO

- Lab report
- Exam study?

### Springs

- Still calculus

### Systems

- Total work is some of individual work
- Work is total change in energy, not necessarily kinetic.
- Thermal enery does not respect boundaries

### Center of Mass

- $F_{\text{net}}=m_sa_{\text{cm}}$
- Acceleration is a vector, mass is a scalar
- Properties hold.
