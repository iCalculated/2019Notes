### TODO

- ACE

### Announcements 

- "When you lose money in business become a professor"
- Court Brief

### Perfect Competition

- Exists and has obvious traits.

### MR. DARP

- Small firms will avoid a high-quantity market
- Price-taking firm phases perfectly elastic demand curve

### Shutdown and exxits

- Fixed costs must be incurred, can choose to shut down if revenue is less than marginal cost
    - Shutdown if revenue is less than variable cost, average revenueis less than average cost, or on a DARP graph if price is less than average cost.
        - (yes, those terms are all synonomous)
- However, repeated loss suggests leaving the industry entirely

### Short-Run Maximization

- Simple  calculus, continue while revenue is greater than cost.
- Remember fixed costs
- This class would be so much better with math and at an actually reasonable pace.
