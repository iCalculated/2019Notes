### TODO

- Actually study

### Announcements 

- Extra office hours Wed PAN110 1000-1100
    - Did not go to the Tues ones
- Exam exists

### Recap

- Speed of rotating object moving down slope is $v_{cm}=\sqrt{\dfrac{2gh}{1+c}}$
- Thus, sphere *fast*

### Moment of Inertia: Parallel Axis Thm

- **Defn'n:** Given the moment of inertial of an axis through the center of mass, then a parallel axis $d$ from the center of mass is $I=I_{cm}+Md^2$.
    - "Proof:" Total kinetic enery is sum of center of mass movement and rotation relative to center of mass. Thus, moving axis causes center of mass to rotate.
    - $K=\dfrac{1}{2}I_{cm}\omega^2 + \dfrac{1}{2} Mv^2_{cm}$
        - Center of mass moves around a circle of radius $d$, so $v_{cm}=\omega D$
- Thus moment of inertia is least through center of mass (but orientation still matters)
- With a group of objects summation still works, but must have same axis.
    - "Proof:" Have you considered calculus?

### Angular Momentum

- **Defn'n:** $L=I\omega=rmv=rp$
    - Can get different value wrt to axis of rotation
    - Is signed, can choose clockwise or counter-clockwise to be positive
    - Is a directional vector
- Conservation of angular momentum exists
- If radious is shortened then angular velocity has to scale
