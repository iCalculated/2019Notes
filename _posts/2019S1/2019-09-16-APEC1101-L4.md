### Invisible Hand 

- Free market is efficient because it maximizes utility
    - Critics say it retains inequality and market fails
- Economics is all about trade-offs    
- Market allows exchange between strangers 
    - Voluntary exchange helps both parties
- **Def'n:** Any voluntary exchange between rational beings &rarr; improve things for both parties
    - Assumes exchange is isolated
    - Free market maximizes exchanges
- "Master narrative" suggests that limitations hurt both parties
    - Imperfect information exists
- Requires three assumptions: 
    - Perfect competition: always matching price and such
        - Large companies compete with advertising
        - Competitiors come together to exploit
    - Perfect information: knowing every possible offer 
        - Extremely difficult in the future
        - Moral hazards (other party bears all risk)
    - You get what you pay for: No third party involved
        - No market for all actions, ex-dumping manure in river
        - No one wants to invest in public goods
- **Market Failure:** Flaws when an assumption is not met
