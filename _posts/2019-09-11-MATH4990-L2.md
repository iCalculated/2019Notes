### Announcements

- 5 problems a week, 3 compute and 2 think probably
- Lots of people had difficulties with four

### TODO

- Hommework lmao

### Affine Varieties

- **Def'n:** A zero set of a set of polynomials: $$V(f_1,\dots,f_2)=\{(a_1,\dots,a_n)\in k^n\vertf_i(a_0,\dots,a_i)=0\}$$
    - Affine versus vector space: Zero is not special in affines
- Twisted cubic: $$V(xz-y^2,xy-z,x^2-y)$$
- If $$V$$ and $$W$$ are varieties, then their intersection and union are as well:
    - For unions multiply functions together
    - For intersections string functions together

### Words

- **Corollary:** Easy follow-up
- **Theorem:** Big important boy. 
- **Lemma:** Small technical point. 
- **Proposition:** Between theorem and lemma.

### Facts

- "Zero isn't special"
- "The lemma does not care"
- "You'll see one of these terms whenever I feel like using them"
- "it's not a vector space! Well sometimes it's a vector space"
- "It'll just confuse you if I write that" *proceeds to write that*
- "I do want to get through stuff, despite the appearance of this class" 
- "I said some words to myself, they are not important"
- "One of these is correct and I've confused myself"
- "Don't worry!"

### Ideals

- **Def'n:** An ideal $$I$$, in a ring $$R$$ is a subset such that:
    1. 0 is in $$I$$
    2. If $$f, g\in I$$ then $$f+g\in I$$
    3. If $$f\in I$$, $$h\in\mathbb{R}$$ then $$h\cdot f\in I$$
- Generation: Given $$f_1,\dots,f_s\in\mathbb{R}$$ the ideal generated is 

$$\langle f_1,\dots,f_2\rangle = \left\{\sum^s_{j=0} h_i f_j \vert h_j \in \mathbb{R}\right\}$$

### Notation

- $$\langle x\rangle$$ All things in the form $$\{h\cdot x\verth\in k[x]\}$$
- **Proposition:** If $$\langle f_1,\dots,f_s\rangle=\langle g_1,\dots,g_r\rangle$$, then $$V(f_1,\dots,f_s)=V(g_1,\dots,g_s)$$
- Variety of an ideal: $$V(I)=\{a\in\mathbb{A}^n\vert\forall f\in I, f(a)=0\}$$
- Ideal of a variety: $$\{f\in k[x_1,\dots,x_n]\vert \forall a \in V, f(a)=0\}a$$
- **Proposition:** $$I\subseteq I(V(I))$$ 
- **Proposition:** $$V\subseteq V(I(V))$$
- **Proposition:** $$V\subseteq W$$ if and only if $$I(V)\geq I(W)$$ and $$V=W$$ if and only if $$I(V)=I(W)$$
