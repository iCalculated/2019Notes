### TODO

- Weekly

### Announcements

- Buy acetominophen instead of tylenol

### Scenario

- Lots of firms
    - Small market share
    - No collussion
- Differentiated Products
    - Product attributes
    - Service attributes
    - Location
    - Advertising
- Free entry and exit
- Like monopoly, $$MR\neq D$$


### Short Term

Functions as a monopoly with a unique product.

### Long Term

Profit is zero, other firms enter the space if it is profitable.

### Flaws

- Close substitutes are usually not made
- Advertising is used to assert uniqueness
- Most consumers don't bother to acquire competition
