### TODO

- Homework
- Queries
    - Calc based textbook?
    - How math/grading?

### Scales 

- Secretly a spring that converts relative to constant, 
    - linear function

### Weights

- Measurement of force, not mass
    - relative to gravity
- Pounds can be converted to newtons
    - wild
- Normal force exists
    - Frictional force does too, but not yet

### Force and Impulse

$$ F = \dfrac{dp}{dt}$$ 

- Applying force to object changes momentum
    - Surprised?
