### TODO

- Chapter 5 homework (hypothetically)

### Kinetic Energy

- **Def'n:** Energy associated with motion. 
    - Breaking functions by converting kinetic to thermal
    - Often collision &rarr; heat
- **Conservation of Energy:** Exists.
    - Holds in isolated system
    - Isolation can be determined by if a process is reversible
    - Reversible indicates mechanical energy is preserved
        - Conversion to heat usually implies irreversible
    - Determined by formula: $$ K =\frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
    - Can use momentum, in the form: $$K=\dfrac{p^2}{2m}
    - 1 J = 1 kg m^2/s^2
- Systems have total kinetic energy

### Collision

- Types:
    - Elastic &rarr; all energy is preserved
        - Relative speed preserved
    - Inelastic &rarr; some energy is preserved
        - Heat produced or stickiness
    - Totally inelastic &rarr; no energy is preserved
- Momentum is always preserved in collisions
    - Not enough to solve the problems
