### TODO

- Still do homework?

### Collisions

- Elastic 
    - Momentum and kinetic energy is preserved
    - Relative velocity is retained
    - Greater mmass &rarr; continues, equal mass &rarr; stops, lesser &rarr; bounce. Following $$v_{f1}=\dfrac{m_1-m_2}{m_1+m_2}v_i = 1\text{ and } v_{f2}=\dfrac{2m_1}{m_2+m_2}v_i$$
    - Solve with P conservation, K conservation
- Inelastic
    - Momentum conserved
    - Solve from loss of internal energy or kinematics
