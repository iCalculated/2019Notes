### TODO

- Actually study
- Lab Report (3-2?)

### Announcement (singular) 

- Exam exists

### Recap

- Summative things happen relative to same axis
- Be consistent with rotational direction

### Noncircular Motion

- Breakdown via perpendicular component of velocity vector relative to radial.
$$L=r_{\perp}mv$$
