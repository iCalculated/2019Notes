### TODO

- Homework Chapter 10, 11, 12 *and* 13
- Lab

### Announcement

- Still no lecture Wednesday

### Gravitational Potential Energy

 - In an orbit potential enery is stored in gravity
 
$$ W = \int_{r_i}^{r_f} \vec{F}\cdot d\vec{r}= -Gm_1m_2\int_{r_i}^{r_f} \dfrac{1}{r^2} \hat{r} \cdot d\vec{r}= \dfrac{Gm_1m_2}{r_f}-\dfrac{Gm_1m_2}{r_i}$$

At a given distance gravitation potential energy is $$U=-\dfrac{Gm_1m_2}{r}$$

### Noncircular Orbit

- Circular orbits are unusual
    - Thus, generalize
- If a satellite is too slow to stay on a circle it's pulled inward, but that then causes it to speed up
