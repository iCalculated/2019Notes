### Announcements

- Quiz is *still* Feb 14th

### TODO

- Homework
- Lab questions (two labs this week)

### Gauss Law

Physics notation is bad,

$\cint \text{ or, in math } \iiint_V (\nabla \dot \vec{F})\ dV = \ciint_S (\vec{F}\cdot\vec{n})\ dS.$

(oh look, it's the divergence thm)

### Surfaces

Convenient surfaces make or break solutions: cylinders and spheres are our friends.

Cylinders let us derive all of the things that were hard last week.

### Conductors

No field inside conductors due to induced charges.

Outside the shell, the field is the same as that produced by a point charge.

Conductors will counter electric fields to reach electrostatic equilibrium.
