### Announcements

### TODO

- Already did the HW because CSCI homework is fun

### Von Kauffman model

Three basic components: CPU which execute instructions, MEMORY where data is stroed, and IO.

(All models are wrong, but some are useful. Probably a play on Von Neuman)

Computers are very dumb, but also very fast.

Cells in memory have addresses that do not change and contents that do.

(mentioned OCaml)

### C 

Variables must be declayed by type, which was new at the time. Equal sign is assignment. Can both allocate memory and set a value in one statement.

Type declarations are useful to the compiler, so it can determine how much memory to allocate. Uninitialized variables in C can be scary because they may have values in them already.

```
int x;
x = 42;
int y = 31;
// "swap" time
x = y;
y = x;
printf("%d %d",x,y);
```

(man programs in emacs and runs arch)

Rule in Unix: Silence is golden, nothing went wrong

gcc can not optimize the tragic swap code above, even at o4.

### Logistics

Hot seats in front, cards get extra points. (No points today)
