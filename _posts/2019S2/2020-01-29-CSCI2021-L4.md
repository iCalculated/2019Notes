### Void Pointers

"C is like a sharp knife, you should be able to cut yourself."

Void points are bad if abused, but they exist for good reason.

In all practical systems pointers are of consistent size, always 8 bytes. (64 bit systems need 8 bytes to store a memory address.)

### Types

Oh wait, there are more!

Many more specific types exist, such as unsigned types or fixed width variants. Fixed types are used for future-proofing since standards sometimes change.

### Pointers versus Arrays

Both refer to memory locations, which for pointers is changeable but for arrays is fixed. We can pretend arrays are pointers and vice versa when passing into functions, which is *absolutely terrifying*, but in a good way. Arithmetic can be done to pointers and they can be pointed at new places, but an array is a matter of compiler allocation.

Brace notation jumps ahead based on the size of the pointer type. Can also shift pointers with arithmetic operations. Notably, void pointer arithmetic will make the compiler angry, though you can cast it for arithmetic.
