### Announcements

- We're still behind schedule, skipping 1.3 

### Sensitivity

We keep an assumption as a variable and derive. Then determine how the critical point changes wrt to the variable.

Actual sensitivity is like elasticity in economics: 

$$S(x,r)=\dfrac{dx/x}{dr/r}.$$

Apparently the term 

$$\dfrac{d(\ln{x}){d(\ln{z})}}$$ 

also works. (It inspired someone to raise their hand and Safonov hit him with the same look)

(Safonov called on our lad and the mistake was pointed out)

The sensitivity value is a relative percentage, a 1% change in the factor $$r$$ results in a $$S(x,r)$$ percent change in $$x$$.


### Lagrange Multipliers

(not sure if we're going to talk about them, but he keeps alluding to it)

(we're doing the problems from last Friday again? Not even with Lagrange multipliers)

Never mind?


### Probability

Let stochastic variable $$x$$ have values $$x_k$$ with frequencies $$p_k=\lim_{n\to\infty}\dfrac{n_k}{N}$$. Let $$N$$ be the number of trials and $$n_k=#(x=x_k)$$, then 

$$E(x)=\lim_{n\to\infty} \dfrac{x_1n_1+\dots+x_kn_k}{N}.$$

(which can also be written as a sum if discrete.)

**Jensen's Thm:** If $$f(x)$$ is convex, then $$E(f(x))=\sum f(x_k)p_k \geq f(E(x))$$ 

- Fake proof: Any convex function $$f(x)=\text{sup}_{\alpha\in\mathbb{A}}(a_\alpha x + b_\alpha)$$, $$\forall \alpha E(f(x)) \geq E(a_{\alpha}x + b_{\alpha})=a_\alpha E(x)+b_{\alpha}.$$
