### Announcements

- Homework still exists.
- My site supports `\vec` but not `\vv`

### TODO

- ~~Homework :(~~ I actually did it.
- New electric field homework (77 min projection)

### Electric Fields

$\vec{F}=q\vec{E}$

*"If you said B you're going to do very well when we do voltage, which is much easier, you just add numbers."*

Generally when doing math with dipoles calculations are done with respect to the center.

*"The first thing we need to do is figure out how vectors add, and they add like vectors."*

Wrt to field lines forces are tangent, just a slope field.

Electric field propogate at the speed of light, thus there is no instantenous action at a distance. As a charge moves, at time $T$ the resultant field depends on where the charge was at $t-d/c$.

When working with vector fields be careful with proportions.
