### Announcements

- Homework still exists.

### TODO

- Homework :(

### Superposition

Electric field stuff is all basic vector calculus. Thus, standard vector magic applies such as addition: $$\vec{F}_{\text{total}} = \vec{F}_1 + \dots + \vec{F}_n.$$

Sum of vectors does *not* dictate velocity, because composition is altered every time position changes.

Induced diople is weaker in materials without conducting electrons.

Feynman lectures might be fun.

### Electric fields

From + to -. (I figured that out on the diagnostic exam)

An electric field, indepdennt of the test charge, $$q$$, depends only on position: $$\vec{E} = \dfrac{\vec{F}}{q}.$$
