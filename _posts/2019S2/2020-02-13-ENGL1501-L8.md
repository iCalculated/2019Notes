## Foe

Construction of place, self, and the other

*What does it mean to be modern or civilized?*

### Susan

Trying to sell her experience, terminology is dramatic and romanticized.

*Why does she need to construct herself as a victim?*

Has ultimate power as the writer. 

Story within a story. Who are the audiences, both internal and external?

Certainty that she imposes over others.

### Friday

Crusoe names Friday in the original book. 

"He only knows the words he requires"

Introduction frames Susan more than Friday She assumes that he's a savage and gets right to the derogatory stuff.

Can tie to the Tempest with Caliban and Ariel.

### Voicelessness

Even if Friday has a tongue, he would not be "able" to speak. Everything relies on subjugation at some level.

Have to use the "language of the criminal" to describe the problem. Language is violence.

### Purpose

Cruso wants to cultivate the land, so he makes terraces even though he has literally nothing to grow.

Pointless expenditure.
