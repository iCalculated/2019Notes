### Facing It

By Yusef Komunyakaa

*My black face fades,*  
*hiding inside the black granite.*  
*I said I wouldn't*  
*dammit: No tears.*  
*I'm stone. I'm flesh.*  
*My clouded reflection eyes me*  
*like a bird of prey, the profile of night*  
*slanted against morning. I turn*  
*this way—the stone lets me go.*  
*I turn that way—I'm inside*  
*the Vietnam Veterans Memorial*  
*again, depending on the light*  
*to make a difference.*  
*I go down the 58,022 names,*  
*half-expecting to find*  
*my own in letters like smoke.*  
*I touch the name Andrew Johnson;*  
*I see the booby trap's white flash.*  
*Names shimmer on a woman's blouse*  
*but when she walks away*  
*the names stay on the wall.*  
*Brushstrokes flash, a red bird's*  
*wings cutting across my stare.*  
*The sky. A plane in the sky.*  
*A white vet's image floats*  
*closer to me, then his pale eyes*  
*look through mine. I'm a window.*  
*He's lost his right arm*  
*inside the stone. In the black mirror*  
*a woman’s trying to erase names:*  
*No, she's brushing a boy's hair.*  

### Prologue to Invisible Man

By Ralph Ellison, 1952

```I can hear you say, "What a horrible, irresponsible bastard!" And you're right. I leap to agree with you. I am one of the most irresponsible beings that ever lived. Irresponsibility is part of my invisibility; any way you face it, it is a denial. But to whom can I be responsible, and why should I be, when you refuse to see me? And wait until I reveal how truly irresponsible I am. Responsibility rests upon recognition, and recognition is a form of agreement. Take the man whom I almost killed: Who was responsible for that near murder -- I? I don't think so, and I refuse it. I won't buy it. You can't give it to me. He bumped me, he insulted me. Shouldn't he, for his own personal safety, have recognized my hysteria, my "danger potential"? He, let us say, was lost in a dream world. But didn't he control that dream world -- which, alas, is only too real! -- and didn't he rule me out of it? And if he had yelled for a policeman, wouldn't I have been taken for the offending one? Yes, yes, yes! Let me agree with you, I was the irresponsible one; for I should have used my knife to protect the higher interests of society. Some day that kind of foolishness will cause us tragic trouble. All dreamers and sleepwalkers must pay the price, and even the invisible victim is responsible for the fate of all. But I shirked that responsibility; I became too snarled in the incompatible notions that buzzed within my brain. I was a coward . . .But what did I do to be so blue? Bear with me.```

Agreement &rarr; recognition &rarr; responsibility. Claims to be powerless but also rejects the responsbility.
