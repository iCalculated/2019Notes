### Announcements

- Homework still exists.

### TODO

- 5 more electric field problems

### Dipole

Two charges of equal magnitude but opposite charge, separated by some distance.

Dipole moment is $$\vec{p}=q\vec{r}$$ where $$\vec{r]$$ is the vector from the negative to the positive and $$q$$ is the magnitude of the charge. Note that the name is "p" because of orbital configurations, every p-shell has an inherent dipole.

An external electric field can induce a dipole in an atom, following the rule $$\vec{p}=\alpha\vec{E}$$, where $$\alpha$$ is polarizability.

Torque induces rotation counterclockwise relative to torque as normal vector. Someone, as in myself, apparently can't remember the right hand rule. $$\vec{\tau}= \vec{r}\times\vec{F}$$. Thus, dipoles will align with external fields.

### Field Summary

Forces are proprtional to:

- Dipole $$\prop R^{-3}$$
- Point charge $$\prop R^{-2}$$
- Infinite line $$\prop R^{-1}$$
- Infinite plane $$\prop R^0$$

Geiger counters have lines of charge in them and count positive ion collisions with the exterior.

### Ring 

Let $$P$$ be conveniently along the $$z$$-axis, along which the center of the ring also lies.

As always, $$d\vec{E}=\dfrac{k\ dq}{r^2}\hat{r}$$ and $$dE_z = \dfrac{k\ dq}{r^2}\cos{\theta}=\dfrac{k\ dq}{r^2}\dfrac{z}{r}=\dfrac{k\dq z}{r^3}$$.

The integral is trivial, $$E_z = \dfrac{kz}{r^3}Q.$$
