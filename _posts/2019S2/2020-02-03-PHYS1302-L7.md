## Gauss's Law

### Objectives

- Comprehend
- Solve for E-field in special cases

### Law

$$\cint \vec{E}\cdot\ d\vec{A}=\dfrac{Q}{\epsilon_0}$$

by convention the normal vector points out.

### Flux

How much current goes through a surface. 

It's dependent on the strength of the field, area of the surface, and the angle between field lines and the surface.

### Coulomb's Law

Can be derived from thinking about spheres, that is where the $$4\pi$$ in $$k$$ is from.
