### Dido's Problem

Maximum area encapsulated by perimeter. (potentially subject to geometric constraints.)

This is infinite dimensional calculus if you want to do it traditionally. Thus, *don't.* Alternatively, recursive reduction is a good trick. Triangles and arc division all the way down.

Solution will usually be a locus of equidistant points, also known as a circle.

Moral of the story: scary problems can be solved, or at least intuitively understood, using elementary concepts.

(Pretty much all of these are competition math problems, which is a good sign)
