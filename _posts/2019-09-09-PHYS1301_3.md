### Announcements

- Solar Vehicle Project (all from 1830-1930)
    - Monday, Fraser 101
    - Tuesday, Fraser 101
    - Wednesday, Bruninks 220 **most viable**
    - Contact: SVP@umn.edu
- Tutors in Tate B25
- Crying in office &rarr; A?


### TODO

- Solar Vehicle
- Chapter 3/4 on Canvas


### Acceleration

- Can eliminate tiem from equation, to get $$\Delta x = \dfrac{(v_f-v_i)^2}{2a}+\dfrac{v_fv_i-v_i^2}{a}\implies 2a\Delta x = v_f^2-v_i^2$$
- Must remember to retain sign

### Gravity

- Gravity at the surface of the earth accelerates at $g=9.8$ m/s$^2$
    - On exams 9.8 is enough for sig figs, but it varies
    - $g\approx10$
    - Projectile velocity is symmetric

### Inclines

- Along an incline at angle $\theta$ relative to the ground the force down the ramp is $g\sin{\theta}$ (not accounting for friction)
