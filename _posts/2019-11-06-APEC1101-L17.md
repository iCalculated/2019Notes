### TODO

- ACE
- Study for exam?

### Review

- Monopolies have MR < P
    - Will not be allocatively or productively efficient
    - Nonzero DWL

### How Evil is Monopoly?

- Good:
    - Utilizes economy of scale
    - Could be natural monopoly
        - **Def'n:** Does not make sense to have multiple firms because of startup price
- Bad:
    - **X-inefficiency:** Not focused on minizing price of production because no competition
    - **Rent-Seeking:** Effort goes towards other causes, such as lobbying

### Natural Monopoly

- High one-time startup cost
    - Thus $$MC << ATC$$
- Machine learning :(

### Regulation

- **Sherman Act (1890):** Attempting to monopolize is uncool.
- **Clayton Act (1914):** Merging to monopolize is uncool.
- When splitting a monopoly, force $$MC=D$$. 
    - Oh no, monopoly dies. ($$ATC < MB$$)
- More reasonably, produce at $$ATC=D$$ potentially with a percentage-based margin.
    - Oh no, monopoly still does not need to cut costs.

### Price Discrimination

- Discrimination &rarr; maximum profit.
- Conditions:
    - Must be able to control output quantity *or* price
    - Must be ~~willing~~ able to segregate
    - No resale
- Discriminate by elasticity
    - Assuming constant MC and zero FC
    - Segment after consumers are satisfied
- Implemmentation
    - Offer rebate coupons, unlikely to be used by upper-class
        - Exploits both sensitivity and prevents resale
