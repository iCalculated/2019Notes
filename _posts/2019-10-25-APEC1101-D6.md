### TODO

- Weekly homework

### Division

- Average total cost: $$\text{ATC}=\dfrac{\text{total cost}}{\text{output quantity}}$$
- Average fixed cost, approaches zero asymptotically: $$\text{ATC}=\dfrac{\text{fixed cost}}{\text{output quantity}}$$
- Average variable cost: $$\text{ATC}=\dfrac{\text{variable cost}}{\text{output quantity}}$$
- Marginal cost, same thing but deltas: $$\text{MC}=\dfrac{\Delta\text{total cost}}{\Delta\text{output}}=\dfrac{\Delta\text{variable cost}}{\Delta\text{output}}$$

### Curves

- (I would draw these but I feel unuually lazy)
- AVC is slightly concave
- ATC asymptotically approaches AVC, distance between the curves is AFC
- MC goes through bottom points of both, because intution
    - Law of diminishing returns sets in after minimum

### Long Run
