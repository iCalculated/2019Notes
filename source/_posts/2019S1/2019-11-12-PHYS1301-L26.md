### TODO

- Homework hypothetically

### Announcements 


### Recap

- Everything is a 3D vector
- $\vec{\tau}=\vec{r}\times\vec{F}$ 
- Magnitude of torque is $\tau = rF\sin{\theta}$
- Net torque is still a summation (relative to axis)

### Torque

- Angular acceleration is $\alpha = \tau/I$ implying a magnitude of $rF\sin{\theta}/I$.
    - Maximized as $\theta\to 90^{\circ}$ and $r\to\infty$

### Torque from Gravity

- Center of mass falls with $a=g$ in free system.
    - Even in a connected system the distribution relative to the center of mass results in no rotation.
- If pivot is not at center of mass utilize CM instead of summation.
