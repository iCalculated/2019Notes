### TODO

- Study for first exam (too late)

### Pendulum

- Enery is retained since just height matters

### Energy

- Addition is a good trick
- With no other source of energy $\Delta K = -\Delta U$. 

### Power

- Enregy over time, $P=\dfrac{dE}{dt}.$
- Similarly, average power is total delta ratio.
- 1 W = 1 J/s = 1 kg m$^2$/s^$3$
