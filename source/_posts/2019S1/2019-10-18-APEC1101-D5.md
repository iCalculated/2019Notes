### TODO

- Weekly homework

### Defs

- **Excludable:** Can stop people from consuming
- **Rival:** Only finite can have good

- Two axes:
    - Private goods are excludable and rival.
    - Public goods are non-excludable and non-rival.
    - Commons are non-excludable and rival.
    - Collective goods are excludable and non-rival.

- **Coase Thm:** Free market solves for externalities.
