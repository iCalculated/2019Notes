### Announcements

- Exam soon
- Research draft due Sunday

### TODO

- ACE 4A

### Midpoint Method

- Midpoint method: When calculating shift in price average old and new price as base
- Elasticity: Given one percent change in $x$ then what is the percent change in $y$?
    - Make sure to apply the midpoint method

### Categories

- Rule of thumb, -1/slope 
    - However, elasticity shifts
    - Midpoint of all lines will be unitary
- Totally inelastic: no correlation
- Unit: one-to-one change
- Perfectly elastic: Infinite change

Got let out literally half an hour early.
