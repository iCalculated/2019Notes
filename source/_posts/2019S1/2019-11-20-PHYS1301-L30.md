### TODO

- Homework Chapter 10, 11, 12 *and* 13

### Announcement

- Pawloski carries a sledgehammer around to feel empowered ever since he demo yesterday

### But what *is* gravity?

- Even dropping the empire state building being dropped from the peak of Mt. Everest moves magnitudes less than the radius of a single object.
- Gravity is a mutually attractive force.
- *Inverse square law:* $F_G=G\dfrac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$, such that $G$ is the universal gravity constant, $G=6.7\times 10^{-11}$ Nm$^2$/kg$^2$.
    - Thus, magnitude depends on masses and distance.
    - Even though moon has much lesser mass, radius is a lot smaller so gravity is approximately a sixth
- Spheres are point objects if you are into astronomy
- Quantum gravitons connect objects with gravitational force, so forces act through other materials.
- Relation to small $g$:

$ g= \dfrac{GM_E}{R_E^2}$

### Orbits

- Gravity pulls bodies towards the center of the system.
- If something is moving in a stable circle

$ F_c=m\dfrac{v^2}{R}$

- Deriving velocity yields 

$v^2=G\dfrac{Rm}{D^2}$

### Tidal Locking

- Moon has become oblong and thus being rotationally stable results in the creation of torque
- Moon creates tides by pulling at the ocean
- Eventually the earth will rotate as slowly as the moon revolves around it
