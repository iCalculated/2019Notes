### TODO

- Study for first exam (too late) (even later now) (ooof)
- Lab 3-6 for pre

### Reminder

Newton's laws still exist as well as gravity.

### Tension

- If connection between objects has mass, then some force goes into it.
- Forces on end of connectors are equivalent but opposite (given no mass)
- **Def'n:** force across a connector
    - Ideally distribution is constant

### Pulleys

- Multiple pullies distribute force over distance
