### Announcements

- Office hours tomorrow

### 1D motion

- $t_i$ for time initial, $t_f$ for time final
- Function relative to time, $x(t)$
- $\delta$ indicates change in
- Displacement is directional
- Velocity is directional
- Average velocity is just delta div
- Instant velocity is a single point (hello calculus):

$v(t)=\lim_{\delta{t}\to0} \dfrac{\delta{x}}{\delta{t}} = \dfrac{dx}{dt}$

- Know basic derivatives
- Distance is directionless displacement
- Speed is relative to magnitude and lacks direction
- Acceleration is rate of change of velocity
