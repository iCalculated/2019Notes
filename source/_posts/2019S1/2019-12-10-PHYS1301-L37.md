### TODO

- Homework Chapter 12 (or part of it), 13, 14 *and* 15

### Announcement

- Final real lecture 
- "Let's get the hell out of here"

### Friction

Motion stops when $F_c=F_s.$

Equilibrium point can be calculated similarly to a vertical spring, except friction opposes movement in both ways, so the system loses energy.

### Drag

Force of drag is proportional to velocity: $F_D=-bv$

$ma=-m\omega^2x-bv\implies a = -\omega^2x-\dfrac{bv}{m}$

which can be written as a differential equation, where

$\dfrac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-\omega^2 x -\dfrac{b}{m}\dfrac{dx}{dt}$

with solution 

$x(t)=A_0 e^{\dfrac{-bt}{2m}}\sin{(\omega_d t + \phi_i)}$

subject to $\omega_d = \sqrt{\omega^2-\left(\dfrac{b}{2m}\right)^2}.$

Logically, if the sin term is set to one then amplitude is 

$A= A_0 e^{\dfrac{-bt}{2m}}.$
