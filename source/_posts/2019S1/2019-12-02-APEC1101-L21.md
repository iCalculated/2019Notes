### TODO

- ACE

### Announcement

- Final on December 14th 

### Analogies

- worker surplus can be calculated as consumer surplus
- max is at point st MRC=MRP. In a monopsony that point is before the social optimum at MRP = W, just like monopoly.

### Factors

We have $MRP=P\times MP_L$, so increase of price or productivity increases demand for labor.

- Technology increases productivity, so higher demand
- Having more of other inputs increases demand for workers
- Increasing quality of labor increases demand for labor.
- Subtitutes (i.e. robots) both decrease demand and increase output, so unknown effect on labor.
- Complement price decreasing does not change demand for labor in the short run in long run output effect increases labor demand

### Elasticity

- If hard to substitute worker &rarr; inelastic
- Short run &rarr; Inelastic
- Low ratio of labor to total cost &rarr; inelastic since shift changes a small percent of total cost
- Inelastic product &rarr; inelastic

### Unions

- Exclusive or craft unions limit supply through licensing structures in a small group.
- Industrial or inclusive unions withold labor for grofit, want more members for more effect. Raises reservation price to $\text{max}(\text{reservation},W_u)$.

### Minimum Wage

Oh look, causes unemployment and does not help the poor. Good against monopol.
