### Announcement

- I did not have my laptop to take notes last week.

### TODO

- Homework lmao.

### Facts

- Someone is solving equations using Newton's method. That's funny.
- It'll be completely anonymous, unless if Google messes up somehow.
- Don't say "I am so-and-so, give me an A"
- I'm going to put "wrong" in quotes, because it's not that "wrong" but it's "wrong" enough for this problem.
- [Jason checking his SAT Subject scores as if he does not know them purely to flex on Akshay]
- *[puts greek letters everywhere]*
- *[Anvya says p]* No, that's a rho
- *["could we have a reminder what affine space is?"]* Affine space is the board
- That was confusing and I didn't realize it
- You can miss infinitely many points, but you must be in a higher dimension
- There are a lot of issues with closure
- *[on the topic of closure]* That's why I'm pretending it's just magic
- I'm not going to write things that actually make sense in algebraic geometry
- Sin and cosine don't exist
- We're just going to give up on (1,0)
- You can only draw real pictures
- The second one is wrong, don't start it yet
- Pictures can deceive you
- The point that does not look nice
- That is a much harder problem that we will never talk about
- I have to finish eventually
- I wrote it so sloppy I confused myself
- *[48 times]* Magic!

### Homework Review

- Apply previous part in 2, or the logic becomes circular

### Parametrization

- **Def'n:** Is a function from $f:\mathbb{A}^k\to\mathbb{A}^n$ such that $V$ is the smallest variety containing $f(\mathbb{A}^k)$.
- Can miss a lower-dimensional subsectio
- Create single-intersection lines through chosen point

### Implicitization

- Eliminate $t$ from the ideal of parametrics
    - Use lex st $t>x>y>z$
- Clear denominators
- **Elimination Ideal:** For $I\subseteq k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ the $r$-th elimination ideal of $I$ is $I_r=I\cap k[x_{r+1},\dots,x_n]$ 
- **Elimination Thm:** If $G$ is a lex gb of $I$ with $x_1>\dots>x_n$ then $G_r$ is a lex gb of $I_r$.
