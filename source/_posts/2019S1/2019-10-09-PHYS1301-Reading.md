*Was looking for a more calculus based introductory text, so I'm reading the first of the OpenStax books. These notes will only cover things that are new or novel, so they will nt be a comprehensive guide.*

All quantities in physics can be determined relative to length (m), mass(kg), time (s), electrical current (A), temperature (K), moles (mol), and luminosity (cd). 

# Newton('s Laws)

A newton is a kg$\cdot$m/s$^2$. Very literally $N=m *a $.

Inertia is the ability to resist force, which follows from the second law: If $m$ is larger than $a$ is smaller.
