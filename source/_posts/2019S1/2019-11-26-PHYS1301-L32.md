### TODO

- Homework Chapter 10, 11, 12 *and* 13
- Lab

### Announcement

- *Still* no lecture Wednesday

### Extended objects

- For spherical shells: treat as a point mass for external masses, but inside force is zero
- Oh look, summation still works.
- Force exerted by a ring: $\vec{F}_{net}=\dfrac{Gm_rm}{((x^2+a^2)^{3/2})}\hat{x}$
- For the outside of a spherical shell, divide into infinitesimally thin rings.
    - (did the calculus on paper, because it was a mess)
- Pay attention when taught Gauss' Law or integrals are a mess.
- Now, we take multiple shells to make an onion
    - Oh look, still a point mass
