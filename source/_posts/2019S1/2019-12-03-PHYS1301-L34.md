### TODO

- Homework Chapter 10, 11, 12 *and* 13
- Homework 15, for final
- Lab

### Announcement

- Still quiz Friday

### Recap

Position as a function of time is $x=A\sin(\omega t + \phi_i)$ with angular frequency $w=\sqrt{\dfrac{k}{m}}$

### Springs

Without external forces total energy is conserved for all eternity.

Total enery is $E+K$, which can be calculated at extremes, $\dfrac{1}{2}kA^2$. At the bottom of the arc all energy is kinetic, so $\dfrac{1}{2}mv^2_{\text{max}}$ but that is rather inconvenient. This does give $kA^2=mv^2$ though.

### Generic System

We have $\omega^2=\dfrac{k}{m}\implies m\omega^2=k$ which would mean that total energy is $\dfrac{1}{2}m\omega^2A^2$

It takes 42 minutes to get fall through a tunnel through the earth, regardless of length.
