### Announcements

- Quiz is *still* Feb 14th
- The Lenovo is back!
- Haines is still making jokes about Clem (Clem!) dying in the South Pole. Beginning to wonder if he's trying to communicate something.

### TODO

- (accidentally wrote my lab report a week early, so now ahead of schedule)

### Potential

Isocontours are level sets, but for a physical scalar field.

Thus, 

$\vec{E}=-\nabla V.$

(we did some integrals but they are even more additiony than usual)

### E-field Near Conductor

E-field is proportional to charge density.
