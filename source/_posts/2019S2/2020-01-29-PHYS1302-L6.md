### Announcements

- Homework still exists.


### TODO

- 3 more electric field problems
- Ask PhysC kids for enlightenment
    - (do they know anything?)


### Two plates

Field $E=4k\pi\sigma$, such that $\sigma = \dfrac{Q}{A}$. Alternatively, just say $\dfrac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}.$

Enlightenment: 

$k=\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}=9.0\times 10^9$

where $\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity constant.

"We use a non-trivial trick" (literally the Pythagorean theorem, I love physics)


### Disk

Integrating wrt to radius and constructing many disks yields $E=2k\pi\sigma$4 for an infinite disk. Makes sense since two plates have double the field.


### Sphere

Outside the electric field is $E=k\dfrac{q}{r^2}.$ Inside it's zero.

"We'll learn that Gauss had a better way of doing thing, instead of investing calculus he just wrote down the answer."


### Conductors

Array of atoms in a conductor have nearly immobile ions, electrons move easily though. In electrostatics there is never a net electric field inside a conductor, the electrons move to cancel it.

Thus, when a conductor is subjected to an external field it induces a dipole that results in no internal charge.
