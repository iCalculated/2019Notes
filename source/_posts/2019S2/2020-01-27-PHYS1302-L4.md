### Announcements

- Homework still exists.
- Will be doing electric fields all semester

### TODO

- 5 more electric field problems

### Electric Fields

Uniform fields are "nice" because calculus can be avoided.

Voltage is $V=d \vec{E}$ such that $d$ is the direction along the field. Makes sense since voltage is potential.

"We don't know about magnets"

### Charge Density

Linear charge density will use $\lambda$, charge per length. ($dq=\lambda dx$)  
Surface charge will use $\sigma$, charge per area. ($dq = \sigma dA$)  
Volume charge will use $\rho$, char per volume. ($dq=pdV$)

### Line of charge

Let length be $L$ and total charge be $Q$, then $\lambda = \dfrac{Q}{L}$. We have $\vec{E} = \int d\vec{E} = \int k \dfrac{dq}{r^2} \hat{r}_P.$

Actually calculating turns ugly, unless if we exploit symmetry mercilessly. Logically, $dq=\lambda dx$, which can be shown with *super* hacky math:

$ dq = \lambda dx\implies \int dq = \int \lambda dx \implies Q = \lambda L \implies \lambda = \dfrac{Q}{L}.$

Let one end of the rod be at $x=0$ and the other at $x=L$, then we can rewrite the integral as

$ \vec{E} = \int_0^L k\dfrac{\lambda dx}{(d+L-x)^2}\hat{r}.$

Notably, direction is fake here, so 

$ \vec{E} = \int_0^L k\dfrac{\lambda dx}{(d+L-x)^2}\hat{r} = \int_0^L k\dfrac{\lambda dx}{(d+L-x)^2}\hat{x}.$

Then u-sub, $u=d+L-x$ which ultimately yields 

$\lambda k \int^d_{d+L} \dfrac{-du}{u^2}\hat{x} = \lambda k\left[\dfrac{1}{d}-\dfrac{1}{d+L}\right]\hat{x}.$

Apply a trivial taylor expansion to rewrite the expression as 

$\dfrac{1}{d}-\dfrac{1}{d+L} = \dfrac{1}{d}-\dfrac{1}{d(1+L/d)}$

and if we assume that $d>>L$ for convenience, then $L/d <<1$. FOr any $\vert\delta\vert << 1$, $(1+\delta)^{-1}=1-\delta$ by physics hack magic, so the previous expression approaches 

$k\left(\dfrac{Q}{L}\right)\dfrac{L}{d^2} = \dfrac{kQ}{d^2}.$

*Oh look*, it's Coulomb's Law, that looks rather compelling.

Gauss's Law will make everything easy.
