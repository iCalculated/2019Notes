## Section 1.1: The Five-Step Method

1. Ask the question
    - Make a list of all quantities in the problem
    - Determine which are variable and which are constant
    - State any assumptions
    - Check units for safety
    - Summarize with an equation
2. Select the modeling approach
    - Choose a general procedure to solve the problem
    - Generally this requires knowledge of field-specific literature
3. Formulate the model
    - Arrange the equations from (1) such that they fit the model from (2)
    - May require additional assumptions! Note them.
4. Solve the model
    - Just use a CAS
5. Answer the question
    - Rephrase the solution without jargon or technical terms
    - If someone can understand the problem they should understand the answer
    - It's not enough to just be right, communicating is as important

**Example:** A local daily newspaper with a circulation of 80,000 subscribers is thinking of raising its subscription price.
Currently the price is $1.50 per week, and it is estimated that the paper would lose 5,000 subscribers if the rate was raised by ten cents/week.
