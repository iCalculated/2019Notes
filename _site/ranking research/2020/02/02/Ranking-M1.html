      <h2>The Markov Method</h2>
<p class="meta">02 Feb 2020</p>

<p>(Reading: <em>Who’s #1</em> by Langville and Meyer)</p>

<p>TODO: All of the matrices are broken and the alternative is to have four matrices, one for each set of labels, the data and then finally a shell matrix. I’d <em>rather not</em> do that, so I’ll get KaTeX working instead (at some point).</p>

<h1 id="the-markov-method">The Markov Method</h1>

<p><strong>Maid Idea: ordering objects “vote” on each other based on statistics from one-to-one relationships.</strong></p>

<p>The Markov Method follows the same principles as the (PageRank method)[http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fcarc-pagerank]. If the method is being used to rank sports teams we can imagine the evaluation process as figuring out how much time a fair-weather fan spends supporting each team. If the fan starts at an arbitrary team $A$, he could ask “who is the best team?” and team A would say “Team B or C, they both beat us.” He would then flip a coin to decide which bandwagon to join and repeat the process ad infinitum.</p>

<p>Immediately there are some potential problems, for example undefeated teams: Our fair-weather friend would end up at that team and have nowhere to go, suiting him perfectly but a ranking system not so much.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>Let’s say that we have a tournament between three teams; A, B, and C. We can make a <strong>voting matrix</strong> from whatever statistic we would like, the simplest being win-loss data. For example, we could have</p>

<p>$\mathbf{V}=\bordermatrix{ &amp; A &amp; B &amp; C <br />
                      A &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 <br />
                      B &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 <br />
                      C &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0}.$</p>

<p>Each entry $\mathbf{V}_{ij}$ is the number of votes team $i$ casts for team $j$. In this case, team A votes for both B and C, indicating that they lost every match, and B votes for no one, indicating that they were undefeated. In addition, note that no team votes for itself, which makes sense since teams can’t compete against themselves.</p>

<p>It seems unfair that A’s votes are worth as much as C’s given that A lost every match, so we will normalize each row to get</p>

<p>$\mathbf{N}=\bordermatrix{ &amp; A &amp; B &amp; C <br />
                      A &amp; 0 &amp; 1/2 &amp; 1/2 <br />
                      B &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 <br />
                      C &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0}.$</p>

<p>However, we still have a major problem! This matrix is not properly stochastic, the aforementioned fan will go to B and never leave. The simplest solution is to replace all empty rows with $1/n$, giving us the stochastic matrix</p>

<p>$\mathbf{S}=\bordermatrix{ &amp; A &amp; B &amp; C <br />
                      A &amp; 0 &amp; 1/2 &amp; 1/2 <br />
                      B &amp; 1/3 &amp; 1/3 &amp; 1/3 <br />
                      C &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0}.$</p>

<p>Now, we compute the stationary vector $\vec{r}$, stationary meaning that $\mathbf{S}\vec{r}=\vec{r}$.</p>

<p>(I’d draw a Markov graph here but I don’t know how to use tikz)</p>

<h2 id="undefeated-teams">Undefeated Teams</h2>

<p>In the example we handled undefeated teams by saying they vote for every team equally, but there are alternatives:</p>

<h3 id="self-voting">Self-Voting</h3>

<p>An undefeated term deserves to give themselves credit, so we let</p>

<p>$\mathbf{S}=\bordermatrix{ &amp; A &amp; B &amp; C <br />
                      A &amp; 0 &amp; 1/2 &amp; 1/2 <br />
                      B &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 <br />
                      C &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0}.$</p>

<p>However, the same issue is present, once the random walk reaches B it’s over. Thus. we take the “teleportation matrix” $\mathbf{E}$, of all 1’s, and let</p>

<p>$\overline{\mathbf{S}}=\beta\mathbf{S}+(1-\beta)/n \mathbf{E}$</p>

<p>for some scalar $\beta$. Notably, a larger $\beta$ means respecting the original data more, if $\beta=0$ then all choices will be entirely random. PageRank uses $\beta=0.85$ and lower value such as $\beta=0.6$ or $\beta=0.5%% have been successful for NFL and NCAA teams.</p>

<h3 id="rejection">Rejection</h3>

<p>(This method seems far more awkward to me, but I have not read much about it)</p>

<p>In this method the undefeated teams send votes back to the teams that vote for them, but it results in an uglier matrix and still has looping problems if there exists a team that lost to <em>just</em> the undefeated team.</p>

<h2 id="improvement">Improvement</h2>

<p>The beauty of the Markov method is that stochastic matrices can be made from any factor, or even a combination of factors. If stochastic matrices $\mathbf{S}_1,\dots\mathbf{S}_k$ are constructed for statistics 1 through $k$ they can then be composed into a final matrix</p>

<p>$\mathbf{S}=\alpha_1\mathbf{S}_1+\dots+\alpha_k\mathbf{S}_k$</p>

<p>such that $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_k$ are a set of scalars that add to one. This makes the Markov method incredibly versatile because any new factor or change in data can easily be incorporated.</p>
