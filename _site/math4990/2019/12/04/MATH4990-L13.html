<p>11.2:</p>

<p>Need proper casework, can’t assume that <script type="math/tex">f(x,c)</script> is non-constant. Case with <script type="math/tex">y</script> terms (as written) and case without (must have solds in one variable and changing <script type="math/tex">y</script> creates infinite solutions). Everyone missed the fact that all coefficients can vanish in some cases, the necessary point being that <script type="math/tex">c</script> is not in the ideal of coefficient functions.</p>

<p>For part (c) a geometric proof is far more slick, we have</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">V(\text{Res}(f,g,x))\supseteq V(I_y) \supseteq \pi_y(V(f,g)).</script>

<p>Since the resultant is not zero, the policy mapping must have a finite number of possible <script type="math/tex">y</script> values, then by symmetry <script type="math/tex">x</script> has a finite number of values thus <script type="math/tex">V(f,g)</script> is finite.</p>

<h2 id="inverse-kinematics">Inverse Kinematics</h2>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p>If we have a robot with segments of length 2 and 3, how can it reach the point <script type="math/tex">(1,1)</script>?</p>

<p>Option 1: Draw circles. 
    - Pro: finds points quickly, 
    - Cons, numerous: does not find parameters, only works with two segments, computationally intensive, requires intersection of conics.</p>

<p>Option 2: Hacky trig.
    - Pro: got the answer
    - Con: requires geometric intuition</p>

<p>Option 3: Algebraic geometry.
    - “This is going to be even less solvable then the other cases”
    - Not the tool for the job, just proof-of-concept.</p>

<p>Start by writing config space.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">a=3(c_1c_2-s_1s_2)+2c_1\text{ and }b=3(c_1s_2+c_2s_1)+2s_1</script>

<p>subject to <script type="math/tex">S^1\times S^1</script> for joint space. The equations can then be solved as a system with the constraints included, <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}(a,b)[c_1,s_1,c_2,s_2]</script>. That system is potentially problematic:
    - division by zero
    - change of leading terms</p>

<h3 id="singularity">Singularity</h3>

<p>How can we move the hand from <script type="math/tex">(1,1)</script> to <script type="math/tex">(-1,-1)</script> in a straight line, given a robot with segment lengths 1 and 1?</p>

<p>We want a function in the joint space <script type="math/tex">j(t)==(\theta_1(t),\theta_2(t))</script> such that if <script type="math/tex">f</script> is the function that describes the robot then <script type="math/tex">c(t)=f(j(t))</script>.</p>

<p>Oh look, <script type="math/tex">(0,0)</script> is a tragically bad point, sometimes it’s okay, but other times the robot needs to teleport.</p>

<p>We have</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(\theta_1,\theta_2)=\begin{pmatrix}\cos(\theta_1+\theta_2)+\cos(\theta_1)\\\sin(\theta_1+\theta_2)\sin(\theta_1)\end{pmatrix}</script>

<p>with Jacobian</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
J_f(p)=\begin{pmatrix} \dfrac{\delta f_1}{\delta \theta_1}(p) & \dfrac{\delta f_1}{\delta \theta_2}(p) \\ \dfrac{\delta f_2}{\delta \theta_1}(p) & \dfrac{\delta f_2}{\delta \theta_2}(p)\end{pmatrix} %]]></script>

<p>which functions as a linear approximation of <script type="math/tex">f-f(p)</script>, the set of allowed directions (following from gradients).</p>

<p>In the case of our function, the specialized Jacobian at <script type="math/tex">f(\frac{3\pi}{4},\pi)=(0,0)</script> is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
J_f\left(\frac{3\pi}{4},\pi\right)=\begin{mathbfatrix}0&\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\\0&\dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\end{mathbfatrix} %]]></script>

<p>which has a rank of 1, thus the point is a singularity (problematic).</p>

<p>In general, a kinematic singularity is a point such that the Jacobian is not full rank, as in</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\text{rank}(J_f(\theta))<\text{min}(\text{dim}(J),\text{dim}(C)). %]]></script>

<p>With the general form of the Jacobian, a point is singular if and only if the determinant is zero. Magic also happens even when a point does not look singular to a human, such as the arm being entirely extended and being able to move along the circle but only move inwards following ambigious (and thus singular) paths.</p>

<p><strong>Prop:</strong> A matrix is rank <script type="math/tex">% <![CDATA[
< n %]]></script> if all <script type="math/tex">n\times n</script> minors vanish. This can be used for non-square matrices to determine rank.</p>

<h3 id="facts">Facts</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>[explains pocket protectors after pen leaks in his pants]</em></li>
  <li>My brain is currently rebelling against this proof</li>
  <li>You can always separate things, and sometimes it turns out to be unnecessary when you’re writing the proof</li>
  <li>It’s not possible but you have to prevent that possibility</li>
  <li>There were some clever arguments people gave, I don’t remember them though</li>
  <li>There are only so many finite sets. <em>[thinks for a while]</em> Well, there are infinitely many.</li>
  <li>This is one of those theorems.</li>
  <li>They just say algebraic things instead of geometric things.</li>
  <li><em>[gets roasted the second he tries to draw a diagram]</em></li>
  <li>90% of the time you just blindly calculate, get an answer, and don’t worry about it.</li>
  <li>I need to choose a point that makes actual sense</li>
  <li>I’m not good at always being correct</li>
  <li>The last time I saw a ruler was highschool</li>
  <li>Did I get the order completely backwards? We’ll see.</li>
  <li>One of my equations has turned into nonsense</li>
  <li>I didn’t technically schedule this, I just didn’t tell them not to do it.</li>
  <li>I don’t feel like spelling “kinematic” right now, that’s why I’m not writing it on the board</li>
</ul>
