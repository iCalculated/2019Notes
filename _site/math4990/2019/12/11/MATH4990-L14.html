<h3 id="idea">Idea</h3>

<p>Take a geometric theorem and say if it’s true or false.</p>

<p>“Geometric” pertains to within the scope of Euclidean geometry (thus, you can’t talk about angles beyond relations). <em>However,</em> we are even more checking if statements are true over $\mathbb{C}$ so intuition breaks down (sometimes).</p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>

<p><strong>(Fake) Thm:</strong> If ABCD is a quadrilateral and N is the intersection of $\overline{AC}$ and $\overline{BD}$ then N is the midpoint of those segments.</p>

<p>We want $\overline{AB}\parallel\overline{CD}$, $\overline{AD}\parallel\overline{BC}$ and ${D,N,B}$, ${A,N,C}$ colinear implies $DN=BN$ and $AN=CN$.</p>

<p>Give coordinates to all of the points: $A=(0,0)$, $B=(u_1,0)$, $C=(u_2,u_3)$, $D=(x_1,x_2)$ and $N=(x_3,x_4)$. Notably, $u$ subs indicate indepdent variables which $x$ subs are depdendent, so it functions as a parametrization of the space.</p>

<p>(apparently I’m worse at being a computer than I thought, because I instantly put together properties without thinking about them :( ).</p>

<p>Next, properties need to be mathematically expressed, such as calculating slope or distance to create rational functions that can be coerced into polynomial form. Vectors are appropriate, but losing finite codomains is alright<em>ish</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Prop::</strong> The following statements have polynomial translations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$\overline{AB}\parallel\overline{CD}$</li>
  <li>$\overline{AB}\perp\overline{CD}$</li>
  <li>colinearity</li>
  <li>$AB=CD$</li>
  <li>$C$ lies on a circle at $A$ with radius $AB$</li>
  <li>$\angle ABC=\angle DEF$</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="actually-proving-a-statement">Actually Proving a Statement</h3>

<p><strong>Def:</strong> A polynomial $g\in \mathbb{R}[u_1,\dots,u_n,x_1,\dots,x_m]$ follows strictly from $h_1,\dots,h_s$ if $g\in I(V(h_1,\dots,h_2))$. 
    - Technically needs to be in the root ideal, $\sqrt{I}={f\vert f^n\in I}$
    - TL;DR: All values in the input space have the desired properties.</p>

<h3 id="facts">Facts</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>[on the gimbal problem]</em> There was enough homework in that problem to make the whole homework that problem</li>
  <li>You guys know what a sphere looks like.</li>
  <li>If I gave you guys a month…</li>
  <li>I don’t like talking too much about real-world relevance</li>
  <li><em>[“real world relvance”]</em> If your plane is pointing straight up two of the directions are identical</li>
  <li>We’re not going to see anything that resembles the real world</li>
  <li>I can’t spell things today, so I’m looking at all of my words and thinking they are not spelled right</li>
  <li>There is a theorem that says it does not actually matter</li>
  <li>Our euclidean geometry is a little bit false, it knows things about $\mathbb{C}$ it shouldn’t know</li>
  <li>We’re just going to ignore that</li>
  <li>This is not an interesting theorem of new content</li>
  <li>It’s going to feel a bit like shoehorning a tool in, but we’re going to use commutative algebra</li>
  <li>The other statement is false, so it’s a bit hard to prove</li>
  <li>Pictures are deceptive</li>
  <li>Right now we can say “we’re human and know which of these are important”</li>
  <li>Sorry, I just got confused by which one is $y$ and which one is $x$</li>
  <li>If your signs get reversed just square everything</li>
  <li><em>[reverses the order of a line segment]</em></li>
  <li>Numbers are not a thing</li>
  <li>I don’t understand what the book is on about</li>
  <li><em>[Jay was trying to figure out which of his vectors was backwards, and I asked if it mattered]</em> Well, theoeretically… nevermind.</li>
  <li>We’ve kind of forgotten the main purpose of this lecture</li>
  <li>I keep saying quadrilateral, I don’t know why</li>
  <li>It depends what you mean by parallelogram</li>
  <li>That’s a good question, I don’t remember how to compute radicals off the top of my head</li>
</ul>
